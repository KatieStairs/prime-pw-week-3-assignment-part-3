      Questions about Unit 3:
      <ol>
        In question 6 it says, "create a for loop" but I ended up
        creating more than one, are multiple ones still considered 
        "a for loop", because it is running through the same array? 
        Or did I do it wrong? I could use some clarification, ha.
